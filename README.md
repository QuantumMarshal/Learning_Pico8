# Learning Game Development with PICO-8
Welcome to my "PICO-8 With Me" repository for PICO-8 game development! This project documents my journey learning game development using the PICO-8 fantasy console and the Lua programming language.

## What is PICO-8?
PICO-8 is a fantasy console that lets you create, share and play tiny games and other computer programs. It has built-in tools for coding, sprites, maps, sound, and it runs on many different platforms.

## Project Goals

- Document techniques and patterns for future reference
- Create a complete game through incremental development
- Share knowledge with other aspiring game developers
